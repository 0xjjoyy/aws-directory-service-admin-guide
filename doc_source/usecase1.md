# Use Case 1: Sign In to AWS Applications and Services with AD Credentials<a name="usecase1"></a>

You can enable multiple AWS applications and services such as the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), [Amazon WorkSpaces](https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/), and [Amazon RDS for SQL Server](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/) to use your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory\. When you enable an AWS application or service in your directory, your users can access the application or service with their AD credentials\.

For example, you can enable your users to [sign in to the AWS Management Console with their AD credentials](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-access-the-aws-management-console-using-aws-microsoft-ad-and-your-on-premises-credentials/)\. To do this, you enable the AWS Management Console as an application in your directory, and then assign your AD users and groups to IAM roles\. When your users sign in to the AWS Management Console, they assume an IAM role to manage AWS resources\. This makes it easy for you to grant your users access to the AWS Management Console without needing to configure and manage a separate SAML infrastructure\.
