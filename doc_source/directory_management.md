# Managing Your Directory<a name="directory_management"></a>

You use the AWS Directory Service management console to perform certain directory\-related actions, such as changing directory information or deleting an existing directory\. After a directory is created, most administrative functions are performed with directory management tools, such as the Active Directory Administration Tools\. 

**Note**  
Simple AD directories do not support [Active Directory Web Services](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd391908.aspx)\. Because of this, tools that rely on Active Directory Web Services, such as the Active Directory Administrative Center, do not work with your Simple AD directory\.
