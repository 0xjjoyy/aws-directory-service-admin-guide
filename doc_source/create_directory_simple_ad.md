# Create a Simple AD Directory<a name="create_directory_simple_ad"></a>

Simple AD creates a fully managed, Samba\-based directory in the AWS cloud\. When you create a directory with Simple AD, AWS Directory Service creates two directory servers and DNS servers on your behalf\. The directory servers are created in different subnets in a VPC; this redundancy helps ensures that your directory remains accessible even if a failure occurs\.
