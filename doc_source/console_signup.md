# Sign Up for AWS<a name="console_signup"></a>

Your AWS account gives you access to all services, but you are charged only for the resources that you use\.

If you do not have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one\.

**To sign up for AWS**

1. Open [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choose **Create an AWS Account**\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

Your root account credentials identify you to services in AWS and grant you unlimited use of your AWS resources, such as your WorkSpaces\. To allow other users to manage AWS Directory Service resources without sharing your security credentials, use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. We recommend that everyone work as an IAM user, even the account owner\. You should create an IAM user for yourself, give that IAM user administrative privileges, and use it for all your work\.
