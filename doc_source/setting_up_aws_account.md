# Sign Up for an AWS Account<a name="setting_up_aws_account"></a>

Your AWS account gives you access to all services, but you are charged only for the resources that you use\.

If you do not have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one\.

**To sign up for AWS**

1. Open [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/), and then choose **Create an AWS Account**\.
**Note**  
If you previously signed in to the AWS Management Console using AWS account root user credentials, choose **Sign in to a different account**\. If you previously signed in to the console using IAM credentials, choose **Sign\-in using root account credentials**\. Then choose **Create a new AWS account**\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code using the phone keypad\.

Your root account credentials identify you to services in AWS and grant you unlimited use of your AWS resources, such as your WorkSpaces\. To allow other users to manage AWS Directory Service resources without sharing your security credentials, use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. We recommend that everyone work as an IAM user, even the account owner\. You should create an IAM user for yourself, give that IAM user administrative privileges, and use it for all your work\.
