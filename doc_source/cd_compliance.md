Customers who use AWS products and services to store, process, or transmit cardholder data can use Cloud Directory as they manage their own PCI DSS compliance certification\. For more information about PCI DSS, including how to request a copy of the AWS PCI Compliance Package, see [PCI DSS Level 1](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/pci-dss-level-1-faqs/)\. |

If you have an executed Business Associate Agreement \(BAA\) with AWS, you can use Cloud Directory to help build your HIPAA\-compliant applications\. AWS offers a [HIPAA\-focused Whitepaper](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_HIPAA_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf) for customers who are interested in learning more about how they can leverage AWS for the processing and storage of health information\. For more information, see [HIPAA Compliance](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/) | 

## Shared Responsibility<a name="sharedresponsibilitycd"></a>

Security, including HIPAA and PCI compliance, is a [shared responsibility](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)\. It is important to understand that Cloud Directory compliance status does not automatically apply to applications that you run in the AWS Cloud\. You need to ensure that your use of AWS services complies with the standards\.
