# Create an IAM User<a name="setting_up_create_iam_user"></a>

The AWS Management Console requires your username and password so that the service can determine whether you have permission to access its resources\. However, we recommend that you avoid accessing AWS using the credentials for your root AWS account; instead, we recommend that you use AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) to create an IAM user and add the IAM user to an IAM group with administrative permissions\. This grants the IAM user administrative permissions\. You then access the AWS Management Console using the credentials for the IAM user\.

If you signed up for AWS but have not created an IAM user for yourself, you can create one using the IAM console\.

**To create an IAM user for yourself and add the user to an Administrators group**

1. Use your AWS account email address and password to sign in as the *[AWS account root user](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html)* to the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.
**Note**  
We strongly recommend that you adhere to the best practice of using the **Administrator** IAM user below and securely lock away the root user credentials\. Sign in as the root user only to perform a few [account and service management tasks](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html)\.

1. In the navigation pane of the console, choose **Users**, and then choose **Add user**\.

1. For **User name**, type **Administrator**\.

1. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**, select **Custom password**, and then type the new user's password in the text box\. You can optionally select **Require password reset** to force the user to create a new password the next time the user signs in\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the **Set permissions for user** page, choose **Add user to group**\.

1. Choose **Create group**\.

1. In the **Create group** dialog box, type **Administrators**\.

1. For **Filter**, choose **Job function**\.

1. In the policy list, select the check box for **AdministratorAccess**\. Then choose **Create group**\.

1. Back in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group\. Choose **Refresh** if necessary to see the group in the list\.

1. Choose **Next: Review** to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user\. When you are ready to proceed, choose **Create user**\.

You can use this same process to create more groups and users, and to give your users access to your AWS account resources\. To learn about using policies to restrict users' permissions to specific AWS resources, go to [Access Management](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) and [Example Policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_examples.html)\.

To sign in as this new IAM user, sign out of the AWS Management Console, then use the following URL, where *your\_aws\_account\_id* is your AWS account number without the hyphens \(for example, if your AWS account number is `1234-5678-9012`, your AWS account ID is `123456789012`\):

```
https://your_aws_account_id.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
```

Enter the IAM user name and password that you just created\. When you're signed in, the navigation bar displays "*your\_user\_name* @ *your\_aws\_account\_id*"\.

If you don't want the URL for your sign\-in page to contain your AWS account ID, you can create an account alias\. From the IAM dashboard, click **Customize** and enter an alias, such as your company name\. To sign in after you create an account alias, use the following URL:

```
https://your_account_alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
```
