# Setting Up<a name="cloud_prereq"></a>

To work with AWS Directory Service, you need to meet the prerequisites for AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, AD Connector, or Simple AD\. For more information, see [Microsoft AD Prerequisites](prereq_managed.md), [AD Connector Prerequisites](prereq_connector.md), or [Simple AD Prerequisites](prereq_simple.md)\.

If you haven't already done so, you'll also need to create an AWS account and use the AWS Identity and Access Management service to control access\.
